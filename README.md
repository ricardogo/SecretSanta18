OK Arek. Is my code NOT GOOD ENOUGH? Is that why you want to change it?
FFS...

Fine, this is how you do it:
- Download the Arduino software
- Go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries
- Search for Neopixel
- Install that

I commented the code so you can change the animations, thresholds, etc!
